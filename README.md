# Sale-of-sports-clothing

We have listed a set of clothes which have a button, if we press what we are doing is registering an event and adding it to the shopping cart which is in the upper right corner. In this cart (which is an arrangement) we can add the courses we want and we also have the ability to delete an item or completely empty it. Finally we have Local Storage so that the data does not disappear and that sales are not lost.

## In this project we use:
* Event 
* Functions
* Arrays
* Local Storage
